Pre-Processing Document 


Step 1 - Filtering out of Keywords 


Keywords like POST, Village,etc can misguide the geocoder, so we use FIND & REPLACE in WPS Office/Excel to replace these words with blanks. 


Step 2 - Correct state column 


Run a pivot table on the state column to check for short forms or wrong spellings of States 



Step 3 - Remove #NAME 



#NAME appears when a formula is applied to a blank record. Use FIND & REPLACE to remove it. 


Step 4 - Convert to text to avoid date formats 


Formatting cells to avoid numbers converted to dates after find & replace. 


Step 5 - use substitute formula for removing special characters  


Find & replace cannot remove special characters.  

=SUBSTITUTE(D2,"~","") 



Using the above formula to remove special characters 



 



Step 6 - pincode length check to make sure its a 6 digit number 



Use formula LEN() to check the number of characters in the pincode column. 6 digit numbers are acceptable, others will be erroneous and hence discarded.
